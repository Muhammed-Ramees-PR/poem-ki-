In Knowledge City, minds unite,
Where learning blooms in brightest light.
Ideas grow like endless sea,
A home for dreams and destiny.

Beneath the stars so calm and high,
The moonlight paints the midnight sky.
A whisper floats on winds that roam,
And every heart finds thoughts of home.

On fields of green, the players dash,
With every pass, a sudden flash.
The crowd erupts, the goal is near—
In football's game, we conquer fear. 🏆⚽
